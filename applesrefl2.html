                                    I have found over the course of this semester that our client, Eric, gave a very genuine first impression. He is motivated to expand renewable technologies and incentivize their usage. I have become more excited about the mission throughout the semester due to my personal investment of work into developing an app. Our product is a technology that will help people understand their energy usage and encourage greener habits. While the product itself has been challenging to develop due to the fact that we have been pushing the limits of the capabilities of the devices to gather data, it is the way that we achieved that goal that has been most important to the client. The data that we are gathering is the product that will help Eric’s venture thrive, and as a team we came up with a way to estimate energy consumption without overly contributing to wasteful consumption of the energy. Thus we are helping to address Emergi’s mission while being good stewards of our resources.

                                    My impression of the client's purpose has not changed during the duration of this semester. It is still clear that the mission they're working toward is relevant and impactful. I continue to be excited by Emergi's approach to pulling us toward the green future. The knowledge-first metric-based strategy they take is unique in the industry, and I hope it drives innovation going forward. The Embit app is key for collection and presentation of these matrics. It is the endpoint with which users interact. Its features (collecting and displaying energy usage data) augment Emeergi's goal of keeping energy consumers educated about their daily impact.
