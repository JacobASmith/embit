                    Embit is for the environmentally conscious smartphone user. It gets users thinking about how much energy their phone really uses, and from where that energy is sourced. Embit strives to be a first step in our homes' meterless future, where devices self-track and self-report their power consumption.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Embit mobile app will be available on the Google Play Store. As a user, you can see your phone's power consumption either directly from your mobile app or on the Embit website.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On the mobile app, you will be able see your phone's power consumption throughout the day, and its consumption by the moment in real time. We'll also show you how much of this power was sourced cleanly using solar arrays.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our vision for Embit is to change how people think about electricity within their homes. Electricity consumption should be transparent - not the black-box utility that it is today. With Embit, it will be clearer than ever where your electricity comes from and where it gets used.
